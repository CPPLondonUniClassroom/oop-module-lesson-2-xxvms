/*
 * Part 3

This is a stretch goal! Compile-time checking is not implemented for these so please share them with us for evaluation.

Version()

Implement a static function that takes no arguments and returns an int - It should always return 2

Split the declarations from the definitions.

Create a .cpp file in the project and move all member function definitions of StringLogger to that file.

Static Data

Create a static int that is set to 2 and have Version() return that instead.
